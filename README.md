Potential Improvements: 
Daily planner: streaks, alert('well done') on all tasks being done, alert ('cant add more tasks') if hours till 10 are full. alert ('sleep time at 10') on add if exceed 10. add task at a specific time.

Fitness Tracker: Look at how many calories user has eaten and alert if going over the limit


Finance Tracker: Ask user what exactly did they spend on and then make a pie chart of those things, maybe have categories?
